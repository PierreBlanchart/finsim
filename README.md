# Financial modeling

A package for financial modeling, and simulation of stochastic processes such as encountered in finance, e.g. Geometric Brownian Motions (Black-Scholes asset modeling) and Jump Decision Processes (Merton asset modeling).

This R-cpp package mostly allows to reproduce the graphics of the blogpost [Financial modeling: a simple statistical point of view](https://medium.com/@pierre.blanchart/financial-modeling-a-clean-short-and-simple-statistical-point-of-view-853dc29efb00). This blogpost explains how to derive the main results of financial modeling such as option pricing under the Black-Scholes model (European and American exercise styles), hedging, portfolio optimization, jump diffusion asset pricing models, exotic options pricing using simulation ...


## Install instructions

To install the R dependencies, run (if needed) from the R command line:
```{r}
install.packages(c("Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo", "cpp11"))
```

You need cuda installed (and a GPU of course). 
Check the CUDA_PATH on your computer in the makefile "./src/Makevars", as well as the R_HOME (this one is left unspecified).

Once you have correct paths specified, install the package from the console:
```console
cd PACKAGE_SOURCE_FOLDER
R CMD INSTALL -l /INSTALL_PATH ./ --preclean
```


## Demos

Demos scripts are in the folder ./demos.
There are 9 demo scripts which allow to reproduce the graphics of the blog post. Plus two additional demos showing how to use cuda kernels to perform simulation of asset evolution under Black-Scholes and Merton models.

I refer you to the blog for the figures.
